# Credit Risk Modelling

This repository contains code for **Credit Risk Modelling**, which is the process of predicting the probability of a borrower defaulting on a loan.  
The model helps financial institutions and lenders assess **how safe it is to provide credit** to an individual based on their profile.

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset used is from Kaggle: [Credit Risk Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/varunraskar/credit-risk).  
It includes features such as:
- Applicant demographics  
- Income details  
- Loan amount  
- Credit history  
- Other financial indicators

## ⚙️ Tech Stack & Libraries
- **Python 3**  
- **Jupyter Notebook**  
- **scikit-learn** → model building, preprocessing, evaluation  
- **statsmodels** → statistical analysis & logistic regression  
- **pandas, numpy** → data cleaning & transformations  
- **matplotlib, seaborn** → visualizations

## 🧠 Approach
1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**  
   - Handling missing values  
   - Encoding categorical variables  
   - Feature scaling  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Distribution of features  
   - Correlation heatmaps  
   - Loan approval trends  

3. **Model Building**  
   - Logistic Regression (baseline model)  
   - Decision Trees / Random Forest  
   - Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score  

4. **Interpretability**  
   - Feature importance analysis  
   - Statistical inference with statsmodels  

---

## 🚀 Results
- Built a credit risk model that predicts loan default risk with reasonable accuracy.  
- Compared multiple models to select the best performing one.  
- Identified key factors influencing loan approval decisions.
